  This is an editor I built to show how easy it is to
  build one. Actually it's not. The HTML part is very
  easy, the meat being taken on CSS and JS. The CSS
  is located in the styles.css file and the JS in app.js.
  Again, jQuery makes things much easier. What this does
  is the JS processes the text that is in the HTML, and
  gives the css HTML complete with classes for builtins, attributes
  functions etc.
